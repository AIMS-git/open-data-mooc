## What is GODAN? Network, Action & Secretariat by Martin Parr, Program Manager at GODAN

An Introduction to the Global Open Data for Agriculture \(GODAN\) initiative, it’s principles and what it does to advocate and develop capacity in the sector. The session will visit some definitions of open data. Through examining the work of the network’s facilitation mechanism \(the Secretariat\), and its research and capacity building and research unit \(GODAN Action\) we will outline some of the experiences and challenges GODAN has had in communicating the value of open data in the sector. Slides are available online at [Slide Share](https://www.slideshare.net/godanSec/what-is-godan-network-action-secretariat/1).
